# Hello!

My name is Wei Wen ðŸš²

Iâ€™m a social worker turned data analyst, driven by the belief that evidence and data should guide the way we design interventions and create impact. With over a decade of mid-management experience in social work, Iâ€™m now building expertise in predictive modeling, data visualization, and storytelling.

ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m working on:
* Predictive analytics projects (Random Forest, time series, regression)
* Data storytelling on health and social issues

ðŸ’¡ What drives me: Integrating data with human outcomes to transform insights into strategies that make a difference.
